"text": "Suppose I want to display something on your screen.\n\n\n\n\n Whether I want to display a web page like this blog post, an interactive web app, or even a native app that you might download from some app store, at least two devices must be involved.\n\nYour device and mine.\n\nIt starts with some code and data on my device. For example, I am editing this blog post as a file on my laptop. If you see it on your screen, it must have already traveled from my device to yours. At some point, somewhere, my code and data turned into the HTML and JavaScript instructing your device to display this.\nSo how does that relate to React? React is a UI programming paradigm that lets me break down what to display (a blog post, a signup form, or even a whole app) into independent pieces called components, and compose them like LEGO blocks. I’ll assume you already know and like components; check react.dev for an intro.\nComponents are code, and that code has to run somewhere. But wait—whose computer should they run on? Should they run on your computer? Or on mine?\nLet’s make a case for each side."
